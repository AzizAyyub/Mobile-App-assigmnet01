This is a Flutter application that allows users to create a simple profile by entering their name, age, and selecting an image. The UI of this application is different and unique from others in the sense that it has a simple and clean design, with a blue-grey color theme, and uses a combination of TextField and ElevatedButton widgets to gather user input and submit the form. Also one of the unique features of this application is the ability to pick an image from the gallery using the ImagePicker.
